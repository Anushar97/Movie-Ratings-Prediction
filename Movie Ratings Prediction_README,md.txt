*Movie Ratings Prediction*

*Simple Overview*

This project predicts user movie ratings using collaborative filtering and other recommendation system techniques. By analyzing user behavior and movie metadata, the project builds a model that can generate personalized movie recommendations.

*Overview*

Accurate movie recommendations enhance user experiences on streaming platforms and help users discover content they'll enjoy. This project uses collaborative filtering to analyze a dataset of movie ratings and metadata, identifying patterns in user behavior and movie features. The system predicts how users rate movies and generates recommendations tailored to individual preferences. The dataset includes user ratings, timestamps, and movie metadata such as genres. The project evaluates different algorithms and incorporates user-item interactions to deliver high-quality recommendations.

*Data Description*

*Datasets*

*Training Dataset:*
Size: 90,836 rows, 4 columns.
Key Features:
userId: Unique identifier for each user.
movieId: Unique identifier for each movie.
rating: User rating for the movie (on a scale of 0 to 5).
timestamp: Timestamp of the rating.

*Test Dataset:*
Size: 10,000 rows, 3 columns.
Key Features:
userId: User ID.
movieId: Movie ID.
timestamp: Timestamp for interactions.

*Movies Metadata:*
Size: 9,742 rows, 3 columns.
Key Features:
movieId: Unique identifier for each movie.
title: Title of the movie.
genres: Pipe-separated list of genres associated with each movie.

*Preprocessing Steps*
Data Cleaning:
Verified dataset consistency and handled duplicates.
Mapped movieId in ratings to metadata for additional context.
Feature Engineering:
Extracted genre information and one-hot encoded them.
Normalized user ratings to address rating biases.
Dataset Splitting:
Partitioned the training data into train and validation subsets for model evaluation.

*Modeling*
Algorithms:
Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS).
Content-based filtering using movie metadata.
Hybrid approaches combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
Evaluation Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

*Exploratory Data Analysis*
Analyzed rating distributions and user engagement patterns.
Evaluated the influence of movie genres on user preferences.
Identified popular and highly rated movies.

*Results*
Baseline Model: Collaborative filtering with SVD achieved strong predictive performance with an RMSE of 0.89.
Insights:
Genre-specific biases were observed, with some genres consistently rated higher.
The system effectively captured user preferences and provided meaningful recommendations.

*Potential Use Cases*
Personalized movie recommendation systems for streaming platforms.
Market analysis of user preferences based on genres and movie trends.
Enhancing user engagement through targeted content discovery.
